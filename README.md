<h5 align="center">A self-taught learner and Full-stack Web Dev. Currently working and building some applications using React Js, Next Js, Node Js, and Express Js. Although I can work as Full-stack but I have more strength when I'm working as a Front-end because I have more interest in visual design and I always put concern and more effort into the design to make users feel easy and comfortable when using the application.</h5>
